 - Fan can follow a team
 - Fan can view upcoming matches
 - Team can view their upcoming matches
 - Team can view their players
 - Only admins can add/remove coaches and event organizers.
 - Admins can view all fans and teams.
 - System-wide notifications for all users.
 - Team specific notifications for team members.
 - Fan specific notifications for fans.
